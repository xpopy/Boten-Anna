# [RIP Discord.py](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1)
Discord.py has ceased development which this project was built upon. It may or may not still work, but Discord will change their API sooner or later and break the bot. You have been warned.



# Boten-Anna
A discord bot written in python

# Note
The bot is not finished, it's only a personal project I've been working on for some time. It works, but there may be bugs hiding in some corners. If you find a bug, please do report it as an issue and I will do my best to fix it.


# Installation (Windows)

1. Download the bot, either as a zip (unzip it where you want it) or clone it using git

2. Install python 3.8.1:

   1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/ and download "Windows x86-64 executable installer"

   2. When you run the installer, make sure you tick the option to "Add Python 3.8 to PATH" at the bottom

   3. Click Install Now

3. API tokens:

         2. Create an application
         3. Get the bot token on the "Bot" tab
