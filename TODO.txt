!play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abamRO41fE&list=WL&index=2&t=0s
	breaks the bot because it thinks it's a playlist
"i'm xxx", bot responds "Hi xxx, I'm bot", enable/disable/5% or something
Check for python version in run.bat

in player controls, check if the controls exists every time we update

on_ready: restart all other player functions too (would fix bot breaking from losing connection)
	rewrite loadging of all cogs to reload if they're already loaded, make it a function that runs on on_ready

REWRITE help, automatically get commands from custom.py and their description
read into default help command https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html#help-commands
	show subscommands in the main help menu
	maybe rewrite help as a dictionary with categories, commands, short description and a long description
	https://i.imgur.com/L2Z3IYo.png
	Move it to initialize so it doesn't have to create it every time we want to check help

[ext.commands] Add support for calling a Command as a regular function.
	might work for help command

set up a wiki like https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Setup
	list of commands
	usage gifs and pictures

maybe use threads for updating files https://stackoverflow.com/a/35240362

commands to add:
	add a command to limit normalization to either on, only default playlist, or off.
		Maybe default to off and only allow creator to allow it on any server they want

fix error message on restarting when bot is connected to voice

convert to https://wavelink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wavelink.html#player
	Allows for seeking, set_eq

Write a short documentation on what functions do

re-enable playing playlists
	best would probably be to webscrape the playlist to get all info
	Try out youtube api for searching and for getting playlist songs
	--playlist-random  may help
	maybe make it like default playlist, a queue of urls
		shuffle?

check if youtube playlist has a "last edited" field so i can save the playlist and not update it all the time
	maybe rework saving playlists so it saves names (name of playlist), time etc?
	set this once done    prepareDefault = True   in   nextSong = getQueueList(mPlayer, procDefault = True, prepareDefault = False)[0]

add undo: https://github.com/pckv/pcbot/blob/master/plugins/music.py
play youtube radio
play streams
soundcloud (apparently youtubedl already supports it, look it up)
